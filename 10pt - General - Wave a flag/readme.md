## Description
Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? This program has extraordinarily helpful information...

## Solution

```bash
$ chmod +x warm 
$ ./warm 
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
$ ./warm -h
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_18788aaa}
```
