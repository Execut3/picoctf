## Description
Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? This program has extraordinarily helpful information...

## Solution

```bash
$ chmod +x warm 
$ ./warm 
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!

Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{XXXXXXX}
```
