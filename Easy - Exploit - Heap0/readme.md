## Solution

Checking the source code, we see there is an overflow in `write_buffer` method. 

By printing address of pico and bico on heap, we can see that:

```
Heap State:
+-------------+----------------+
[*] Address   ->   Heap Data   
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x5e0170c0c2b0  ->   pico
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x5e0170c0c2d0  ->   bico
+-------------+----------------+
```

there is a `0x20` byte space between them. So if we write more that 32 bytes on stack, the heap value of `safe_var` will be overwritten,
Which will lead to flag.
